# 🎁 WOD — Wish • Organize • Delight

## 📘 Project Overview
**WOD** is a digital gifting platform that simplifies the process of sharing, organizing, and contributing to personalized gifts.  
It allows users to create wishlists, explore gift ideas, reserve gifts to avoid duplication, and contribute as groups for shared presents.
